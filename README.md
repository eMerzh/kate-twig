kate / katepart / KSyntaxHighlighting syntax highlighting for Twig

The Twig highlighting file was shamefully copied from the Django tpl syntax file.

Installation
============

Just copy the file to your katepart or KSyntaxHighlighting directory.
Usually:

    cp ./twig.xml ~/.kde4/share/apps/katepart/syntax/

    or

    /home/USER/.local/share/katepart5/syntax/
    
    or (KDE Frameworks 5.29+)
    
    ~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax/

The syntax directory may need to be created first.
